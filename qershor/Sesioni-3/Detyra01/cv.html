        <h3><i><u> What is Lorem Ipsum?</u></i></h3>
        <p title="Lorem Ipsus"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <strong>It was popularised in the 1960s </strong>with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>   

      <!-- Inline CSS -->
      <span class="changeColors">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br> 
      </span><span>McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br> and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus <br> Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br> The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</span> <ins>sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose.</ins>

      <h3><em><u> Why do we use it?</u></em></h3>
      <span style="color: blue;">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less</span> <br> <span>distribution of letters, as opposed to using <s>'Content here, content here'</s>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now <br> use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <del> Various versions have evolved over the years, </del><br> sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</span>
